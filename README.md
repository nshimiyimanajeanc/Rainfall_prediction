# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction project, a machine learning solution designed to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. This project aims to assist in forecasting precipitation, providing valuable insights for various applications such as agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.

## Problem Statement

Predicting rainfall is a critical task for various sectors, but it comes with its challenges, including:

- Handling and analyzing large sets of historical weather data.
- Developing accurate models to predict rainfall based on relevant features.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for accessing and interpreting the prediction results.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess historical weather data to extract relevant features for rainfall prediction.

2. **Machine Learning Model**

3. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface allowing users to input data and receive rainfall predictions. This interface may include a web application or API.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Rainfall Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical weather data including features (temperature, Realative humidity, wind speed,  etc.)

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Use tools (Pandas and NumPy) to clean and preprocess the data, extracting relevant features for the model and calculate correlation.

3. **Model Development**: Implement a machine learning model using libraries such as Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. Train the model on the preprocessed data.

4. **User Interface Development (Optional)**: If desired, create a user interface for inputting data and obtaining rainfall predictions. This can be a web application, API, or another suitable interface.

5. **Testing and Evaluation**: Test the model's performance using a separate dataset and evaluate its accuracy in predicting rainfall. Use Percentage Bias, R-square, 5.6.2.	Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), etc

6. **Documentation**:Interpret results, and any dependencies required.
